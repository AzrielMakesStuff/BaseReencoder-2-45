# BaseReencoder-2-45
This is a script fully written in Java in order to allow you to input any base encoded Alphanumeric Values 2-45 and reencode it to any other encoding between 2 &amp; 45

In order for this to function you must install either a Java compatable debugger or JRE(Java Runtime Environment) https://www.oracle.com/nz/java/technologies/downloads/

# Running:
To run it with a Java compatable program such as VSCode will be self explanatory, else if you are running it with only th JRE, you need to open A terminal command prompt window and navigate using the cd command to the directory you hava the .java file in, then run:
# java BaseToBase.java
